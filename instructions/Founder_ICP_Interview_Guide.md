# Founder interview guide for ICP, personas, and competitors

Use this as a flexible script for a ~60-minute CEO/CTO interview. Each section maps to variables you’ll need for ICPs, personas, and competitive analysis.

## 1. Company basics & product

1. **Name and stage**
   - What’s the company called, and are there any separate product brand names I should know?
   - How would you describe your current stage (pre-revenue / early customers / growth-stage)? Roughly where are you in terms of customers or ARR?

2. **What you do (problem-first)**
   - In 2–3 sentences, how do you explain what you do to a smart but non-technical exec?
   - What problem are you solving, and for whom, in plain language?

3. **Product / service overview**
   - Walk me through what you actually sell today. Is it SaaS, services, a platform, a product + services bundle?
   - What are the top 2–3 outcomes customers hire you for?

4. **Current positioning**
   - When you pitch, how do you describe your category or frame yourself?  
     (e.g., “we’re a lighter alternative to X”, “we sit between tools A and B”, “we’re a new category”)
   - If a prospect asks “so how are you different from X?”, what’s your go-to one-liner?

5. **Pricing model & deal size**
   - How do you price today? (seats, usage, tiers, flat fee, services hours, etc.)
   - What’s a typical annual deal size or range, and who usually signs the contract?

## 2. Ideal customers, segments & markets

6. **Ideal customer profile (company level)**
   - Describe your absolute dream customer as if it were a single company: industry, size, region, tech maturity, culture, etc.
   - What pains do they feel that make them a “perfect fit” for you?

7. **Target company size & industries**
   - For your happiest customers so far, what’s their rough employee range? Revenue range?
   - Which verticals or use cases are no-brainers for you right now, and which are still experimental?

8. **Geography & market focus**
   - Where are you actively selling today (countries/regions)?
   - Are there any regions you intentionally avoid or aren’t ready for yet?

9. **Target market segments (roles & teams)**
   - Who actually buys from you? Titles, departments, and functions (economic buyer, champion, power users).
   - Are there specific segments (e.g., “Series B SaaS in North America with remote teams”) that you’re prioritizing?

10. **Segments to prioritize vs. avoid**
    - Of all the potential segments, which 2–3 are your “must-win” focus areas for the next 12–18 months?
    - Are there any customer types or segments you explicitly **do not** want? (too small, too enterprise, too custom, etc.)
    - What patterns in past deals make you say, “We should avoid these from now on”?

11. **How many distinct personas**
    - When you think about buyers/users, how many distinct “types” do you see?  
      (e.g., CEO, Head of Ops, IT admin, end-user manager)
    - Which of those personas matter most for the next stage of growth?

## 3. Existing customers & data

      - Main contact’s title and team  
    - What do these “perfect” customers have in common?

13. **Customer use cases & success**
   - For those best customers, what are they actually using you for day-to-day?
   - What does “success” look like for them in your own words? Any hard metrics they’ve mentioned?

14. **Customer quotes & language**
   - Can you recall 3–5 real quotes or near-exact paraphrases customers have said about:
     - Their pain before you  
     - Why they chose you  
     - The impact after using you  
   - Any colorful phrases that show up repeatedly on calls or emails?

15. **Existing collateral & data**
   - What assets already exist that I should see? (website, pitch deck, one-pagers, Notion docs, PDFs)

     - Who are the evaluators / blockers (IT, security, finance, procurement)?

You can drop this straight into Notion or a doc as your standard “founder download” template, then map each answer into your two super prompts without hunting for missing variables later.
