The dirty secret about multi-touch attribution that nobody wants to talk about: it works great when you have 100 leads a month. It breaks completely at 10,000.

The math doesn't scale. The models assume independence between touches. They don't account for brand halo effects. And they definitely can't handle the reality that most B2B purchases involve 6-10 stakeholders who each have their own journey.

What actually works? Focus on incrementality testing and media mix modeling. Accept that you'll never have perfect attribution—but you can still make better decisions.
