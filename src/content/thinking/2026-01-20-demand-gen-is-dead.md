Everyone keeps saying demand gen is dead. They're wrong, but they're also not entirely wrong.

What's actually dead:
- Spray-and-pray cold outreach
- Generic gated content
- The MQL handoff without context
- "Leads" as a north star metric

What's very much alive:
- Intent-driven outbound
- Ungated value-first content
- Signal-based routing
- Pipeline and revenue as the only metrics that matter

The shift isn't from "demand gen" to something else. It's from volume-based demand gen to precision-based demand gen.

The playbook hasn't changed. The inputs have.
