A quick roundup of the tools that have earned space in my workflow this week:

1. **Claude Opus 4.5** - For everything from strategy docs to code review. The context window is a game-changer.

2. **Cursor IDE** - Pair programming with AI that actually understands my codebase. Building landing pages in half the time.

3. **Linear** - Finally a project management tool that doesn't feel like it was designed by committee.

4. **Figma AI** - The new auto-layout suggestions are surprisingly good.

5. **Arc Browser** - The vertical tabs and spaces feature has completely changed how I organize client work.

What tools are you finding indispensable right now?
